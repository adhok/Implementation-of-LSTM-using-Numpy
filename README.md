#Implementation-of-a-simple-RNN-in-Numpy

A crude implementation of a simple single layered LSTM (with backpropagation) using Numpy to classify sentiment.

🧠 An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at capturing and retaining long-term dependencies in sequential data.



👨‍💻 In the Python notebook, a stepwise approach to implementing a single-layered LSTM is presented. Using this , we implement sentiment prediction on Olist product reviews (written in Portuguese) using only NumPy, a powerful Python-based computational library for performing linear algebra-based operations.

🔥 The single-layered LSTM  was an improvement over RNNs which achieved a classification accuracy of 65%. The LSTM achieved a classification accuracy of 80%
